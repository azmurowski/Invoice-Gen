# Invoice-Gen
Automated creating invoices and played a little with making Tkinter a bit more beautiful. Result - spaghetti code - as I was figuring it out as I want, but otherwise does what I want. 

In the version on my machine it pulls the data for invoices from a gsheet where most of the calculations are done. 

I've included this version a copy of gsheet in the G-Sheet Version folder - if you want to try it out you'll have to get the API running on your google drive (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnPlKLEGR7E), get the creds json and share it with the gsheet you need to copy to your drive. 

Enjoy
